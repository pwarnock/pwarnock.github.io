# Gitleaks Ignore List
# This file allowlists development artifacts and configuration files that trigger
# false positives in secret scanning but are NOT actual secrets.
#
# Guidelines for maintenance:
# - Only add paths/patterns for development artifacts (build logs, scripts with example output)
# - NEVER allowlist actual credentials, tokens, or API keys
# - Document WHY each entry is allowlisted with specific context
# - Review quarterly and remove entries that are no longer needed
# - When this file grows beyond 10 entries, investigate if the root cause can be fixed

# Pre-push Hook
# Contains ANSI escape sequences (e.g., \033[0;31m) for colored terminal output
# and references to FORCE_PUSH environment variable for CI/CD automation.
# These are intentional development safety guardrails, not secrets.
.husky/pre-push

# Gitleaks Configuration
# This configuration file itself is safe to version control and may contain
# example patterns or documentation about what false positives exist.
gitleaks.toml

# This allowlist file - safe to version control
