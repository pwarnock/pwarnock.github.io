## Version Information

- **Version**: v0.8.1-bug-fixes
- **Type**: Patch Release
- **Focus**: Critical bug fixes and content corrections
- **Release Date**: October 27, 2025

## Overview

This patch version addresses critical issues discovered after the v0.8.0-upstream-integration release. The focus is on fixing incorrect URLs and adding missing demo links to improve user experience and content accuracy.

## Issues Addressed

### 1. DeepAgent URL Correction (pw-8)

**Problem**: The DeepAgent tool page was pointing to an incorrect URL `https://deepagent.dev/` instead of the correct `https://deepagent-desktop.abacus.ai/`.

**Solution**:

- Updated `external_url` in frontmatter
- Updated `website` field in frontmatter
- Updated content references in getting started section
- Updated external links section

**Impact**: Users can now correctly access the DeepAgent tool website.

### 2. Vocabulary Game Demo Link (pw-9)

**Problem**: The vocabulary game portfolio item was missing a live demo link, making it difficult for users to experience the working application.

**Solution**:

- Added `demo_url` field to frontmatter
- Added live demo section with link to `https://pwarnock.github.io/vocabulary-game/`
- Provided clear call-to-action for trying the demo

**Impact**: Users can now immediately try the vocabulary game without needing to clone and build the repository.
