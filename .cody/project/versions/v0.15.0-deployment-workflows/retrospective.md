## Lessons Learned 📚

### Technical Lessons

1. **Schema Modularity**: Breaking structured data into separate partial files
   improved maintainability
2. **Conditional Inclusion**: Using frontmatter parameters for schema inclusion
   provides flexibility
3. **Validation First**: Implementing validation early prevented integration
   issues later
4. **Documentation Synchronization**: Updating docs immediately after each
   feature prevented documentation debt

### Process Lessons

1. **Atomic Tasking**: Small, focused tasks enabled rapid progress and easy
   tracking
2. **Issue-Driven Development**: Using Beads for all tasks improved
   accountability and visibility
3. **Incremental Validation**: Testing each component independently simplified
   integration
4. **Comprehensive Planning**: Initial feature breakdown prevented scope creep

### Architectural Lessons

1. **Data-Driven Configuration**: Using TOML/YAML for configuration improved
   maintainability
2. **Template Modularity**: Separating concerns into partials improved
   reusability
3. **Environment Isolation**: Proper environment separation prevented
   configuration conflicts
4. **Performance Awareness**: New infrastructure designed with performance
   impact in mind

## What Could Be Improved 🔧

### Technical Improvements

- **Schema Testing**: Add automated testing for structured data validation
- **Performance Monitoring**: Implement ongoing performance monitoring for new
  infrastructure
- **Error Handling**: Enhance error messages and debugging capabilities
- **Configuration Validation**: Add pre-commit validation for environment
  configurations

### Process Improvements

- **Task Estimation**: Improve time estimation for complex infrastructure tasks
- **Documentation Templates**: Create templates for faster documentation
  generation
- **Integration Testing**: Add comprehensive integration test suite
- **Automated Testing**: Expand automated test coverage for new infrastructure

### Documentation Improvements

- **Usage Examples**: Add more practical examples for all implemented features
- **Troubleshooting Guides**: Create comprehensive troubleshooting documentation
- **Video Tutorials**: Consider video documentation for complex workflows
- **API Documentation**: Document all available configuration options and
  parameters
