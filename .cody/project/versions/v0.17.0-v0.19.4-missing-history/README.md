# v0.17.0 - v0.19.4 Missing Version History

## Overview

This directory contains reconstructed version history for v0.17.0 through
v0.19.4 based on git commit history and project context. These versions were
implemented but not fully documented in the Cody framework during the transition
period.

- Automated release preparation and validation
- Release notes generation and management
- Rollback procedures and safety measures

**Technical Implementation:**

- Release preparation scripts
- Automated validation and testing
- Release notes generation
- Rollback automation

### v0.19.0 - v0.19.4 - Style Guide Updates

**Date**: ~2025-11-18-22  
**Status**: ✅ Completed  
**Focus**: Grid spacing system and data-driven components

**Key Features:**

- Data-driven component architecture
- Style guide updates for new patterns
- Component standardization improvements

**Technical Implementation:**

- CSS grid system with spacing scale
- Data-driven component configuration
- Updated style guide documentation
- Component library enhancements

## Reconstruction Notes

### Sources Used

- Git commit history and messages
- Package.json version progression
- Project file changes and timestamps
- Documentation references in later versions

### Limitations

- Exact feature details may be incomplete
- Specific implementation details reconstructed from context
- Some retrospective information may be missing
- Exact dates are approximate based on git history

### Integration with Cody Framework

These versions bridge the gap between early Cody documentation (v0.4.0-v0.16.0)
and current comprehensive documentation (v0.20.0+). They represent important
infrastructure and workflow improvements that established the foundation for
current development practices.

## Historical Context

### Evolution Pattern

- **v0.17.0**: Foundation - Version management automation
- **v0.18.0**: Process - Professional release workflow
- **v0.19.x**: Refinement - Style guide and component improvements

### Impact on Current Development

These versions established:

- Current semantic versioning practices
- Professional release management workflows
- Component and styling standards
- Documentation and process improvements

## Documentation Status

**Reconstruction Quality**: Medium - Based on git history and project context  
**Completeness**: High - All major features and improvements documented  
**Accuracy**: Good - Technical details reconstructed from available evidence

## Integration Notes

This reconstructed history should be considered alongside the fully documented
versions (v0.4.0-v0.16.0 and v0.20.0+) to provide complete project evolution
context. The patterns and practices established in these versions continue to
influence current development workflows.

**Note**: This represents best-effort reconstruction of version history during a
transition period in documentation practices. Some details may be approximate
based on available evidence.
