## 2. Technical Architecture Overview
_High-level technical structure that supports all features in this version._

The frontend stack consists of:
- **Hugo**: Static site generator for content management and build process
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for responsive design
- **Daisy UI**: Component library built on Tailwind CSS for consistent UI components
- **JavaScript**: Vanilla JS for interactive components (theme switching, form validation)
- **LocalStorage**: Client-side storage for user preferences

## 3. Implementation Notes
_Shared technical considerations across all features in this version._

- **Responsive Design**: All components must be mobile-first and work seamlessly across desktop, tablet, and mobile viewports
- **Accessibility**: Implement proper ARIA labels, semantic HTML, and keyboard navigation
- **Performance**: Minimize JavaScript bundle size and optimize CSS delivery
- **Browser Compatibility**: Ensure compatibility with modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- **Theme Integration**: All components must respect the theme switching system and work with all available themes

## 4. Other Technical Considerations
_Shared any other technical information that might be relevant to building this version._

- **Component Reusability**: Design components to be reusable across different page types
- **CSS Organization**: Use Tailwind's @apply directive for custom component styles where needed
- **JavaScript Modularity**: Keep JavaScript functions modular and avoid global namespace pollution
- **Testing Strategy**: Manual testing across different devices and browsers since no automated testing framework is available
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Ensure core functionality works without JavaScript

## 5. Open Questions
_Unresolved technical or product questions affecting this version._

- Should the newsletter component integrate with a specific email service provider?
- Are there specific social media platforms that should be prioritized for the social links component?
