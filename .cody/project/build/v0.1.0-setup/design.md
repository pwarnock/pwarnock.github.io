# Version Design Document : v0.1.0-setup
Technical implementation and design guide for the upcoming version.

## 1. Features Summary
This version establishes the foundational architecture for the Hugo website rebuild. It includes setting up a new Hugo project, integrating Tailwind CSS and Daisy UI, and creating base layout templates with consistent component design.

Key features:
- Hugo Project Setup: Initialize a new Hugo project with proper configuration
- Tailwind Integration: Set up Tailwind CSS in the Hugo build process
- Daisy UI Integration: Add Daisy UI component library for consistent styling
- Base Layout Templates: Create foundational templates using Daisy UI components

## 2. Technical Architecture Overview
- **Static Site Generator**: Hugo for content management and site generation
- **Styling Framework**: Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling
- **Component Library**: Daisy UI built on Tailwind for consistent UI components
- **Build Process**: Hugo with integrated Tailwind compilation
- **Hosting**: GitHub Pages for deployment
- **Version Control**: Git for source control

The architecture follows Hugo's theme structure with custom layouts, partials, and assets for Tailwind/Daisy UI integration.

## 3. Implementation Notes
- Use Hugo extended version for SCSS/Sass support if needed for Tailwind
- Configure Tailwind via PostCSS in Hugo's asset pipeline
- Install Daisy UI as a Tailwind plugin
- Create base layout templates in layouts/_default/ with Daisy UI classes
- Ensure responsive design foundations are established
- Follow Hugo's naming conventions for templates and partials

## 4. Other Technical Considerations
- Maintain compatibility with existing Hugo features (shortcodes, data files)
- Ensure build performance with Tailwind purging
- Set up development server with hot reload for Tailwind changes
- Document configuration options for future customization
- Consider accessibility best practices in base templates

## 5. Open Questions
- Which Hugo version to target (latest stable recommended)
- Specific Tailwind/Daisy UI versions for compatibility
- Whether to use Hugo modules or traditional theme structure
- How to handle existing theme remnants if any migration occurs
