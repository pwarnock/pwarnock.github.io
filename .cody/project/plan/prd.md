## Summary

Rebuilding peterwarnock.com, a personal portfolio and blog site, with a stable,
maintainable frontend using Hugo, Tailwind CSS v4, and Daisy UI to resolve style
conflicts, improve component architecture, and enable easier maintenance and
modifications. The project has evolved through multiple versions (v0.1.0 through
v0.9.3) and is currently implementing v0.10.0 spacing scale improvements.

## Goals

- Create a website foundation that's easy to maintain and modify without style
  conflicts
- Integrate Daisy UI consistently for a cohesive, professional design system
- Ensure proper responsive design and component alignment (e.g., navbar edges
  matching content)
- Preserve all existing functionality while building on a better architectural
  foundation
- Enable quick iteration and changes that are immediately visible
- Implement systematic spacing scale using CSS variables to replace hardcoded
  utilities
- Establish maintainable design patterns and refactoring guidelines

## Target Users

Primary audience includes recruiters, colleagues, and potential clients who
visit the site to:

- Read Peter's blog posts about technology, leadership, and development
- View his professional portfolio and experience
- Learn about his skills in fullstack development, DevOps, and cloud
  technologies
- Contact him or subscribe to his newsletter
- Follow his social media profiles

## Key Features

- Blog functionality with post listings, individual post pages, and categories
- Professional portfolio sections showcasing experience, skills, and expertise
- Newsletter subscription system
- Social media links and contact information
- Responsive design with consistent Daisy UI components
- Clear component architecture compatible with Tailwind themes
- SEO-optimized structure maintaining existing URLs
- GitHub Pages hosting compatibility
- CSS variable-based spacing system for maintainable design
- Automated development server management with PM2
- Comprehensive linting and validation pipeline
- Security headers and accessibility compliance

## Success Criteria

- Agents can make changes (adding sections, modifying layouts, updating
  components) without encountering style conflicts
- Changes are immediately visible and applied correctly
- Navbar and content edges align properly across all screen sizes
- Consistent Daisy UI styling throughout the site
- All existing features (blog, portfolio, newsletter, social links) are
  preserved and functional
- Site loads and performs well on GitHub Pages
- Spacing scale implementation reduces hardcoded utilities by 250+ instances
- Zero visual regressions during refactoring phases
- Automated testing and validation pipeline passes
- Security vulnerabilities are promptly addressed (e.g., PM2 updates)

## Out of Scope

- Complete visual redesign or rebranding
- Addition of new major features beyond current functionality
- Migration to different hosting platforms
- Integration with external services beyond current setup

## User Stories

- As a recruiter, I want to easily navigate Peter's portfolio and blog to assess
  his qualifications and experience
- As a colleague, I want to read his latest posts and stay updated on his
  professional insights
- As a potential client, I want to view his skills and contact him for
  collaboration opportunities
- As Peter, I want to add new blog posts and portfolio items without dealing
  with conflicting styles or alignment issues
- As Peter, I want to modify site components and see changes applied quickly and
  consistently

## Assumptions

- Hugo, Tailwind CSS v4, and Daisy UI are suitable and compatible for this
  rebuild
- Existing content (blog posts, portfolio data) can be migrated without data
  loss
- GitHub Pages will continue to host the site adequately
- No additional budget for premium tools or services
- We may explore minimal themes but will avoid complex community themes that
  cause conflicts; the custom Daisy UI approach simplifies maintenance
- CSS variable-based spacing system will improve maintainability without
  breaking existing functionality
- PM2 process management provides stable development environment
- Automated linting and validation ensures code quality

## Dependencies

- Hugo static site generator
- Tailwind CSS v4 framework
- Daisy UI component library
- GitHub Pages for hosting
- Existing content management (markdown files for posts)
- Current domain and SEO setup
- PM2 for development server management
- PostCSS for CSS processing
- Stylelint for CSS linting
