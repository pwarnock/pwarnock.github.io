## Overview

This plan outlines the implementation of rebuilding peterwarnock.com, a personal portfolio and blog site, with a stable, maintainable frontend using Hugo, Tailwind CSS, and Daisy UI. The goal is to resolve style conflicts, improve component architecture, and enable easier maintenance while preserving all existing functionality (blog, portfolio, newsletter, social links).

## Architecture

The site will be a static site generated by Hugo, using Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling and Daisy UI for consistent component design. Content will be managed in Markdown files, with no backend required. The site will be hosted on GitHub Pages for free hosting with SEO preservation.

## Components

- Header/Navbar: Navigation with responsive menu and branding
- Main Content: Blog post listings, individual post pages, portfolio sections
- Footer: Newsletter subscription, social links, contact information
- Layout Components: Responsive containers, cards, buttons using Daisy UI
- Content Components: Blog cards, portfolio items, skill showcases

## Data Model

- Blog Posts: Markdown files with frontmatter (title, date, tags, content)
- Portfolio Data: Static sections for experience, skills, projects
- Site Configuration: Hugo config for site metadata, social links, newsletter settings
- Assets: Images, icons, and other media files

## Major Technical Steps

- Set up new Hugo project with Tailwind CSS and Daisy UI integration
- Create base layout templates with consistent Daisy UI components
- Migrate existing blog posts and portfolio content
- Implement responsive navigation and content layouts
- Add newsletter subscription and social link components
- Configure SEO and GitHub Pages deployment
- Test responsiveness and component alignment across devices

## Tools & Services

- Hugo: Static site generator
- Tailwind CSS: Utility-first CSS framework
- Daisy UI: Component library for Tailwind
- GitHub Pages: Free hosting and deployment
- Git: Version control
- Markdown: Content authoring

## Risks & Unknowns

- Potential conflicts with minimal themes if explored
- Ensuring all existing URLs and SEO are preserved during migration
- GitHub Pages limitations on dynamic features (newsletter handled externally)
- Time required to resolve remaining color and alignment issues
- Compatibility of Daisy UI with existing content structure

## Milestones

- Milestone 1: Project setup and base architecture (Hugo + Tailwind + Daisy UI)
- Milestone 2: Content migration and basic layouts
- Milestone 3: Component implementation and responsive design
- Milestone 4: Testing, SEO verification, and deployment preparation
- Milestone 5: Final deployment and post-launch validation

## Environment Setup

- Install Hugo (latest version)
- Install Node.js and npm for Tailwind CSS
- Clone the repository
- Run `hugo server` for local development
- Configure Tailwind and Daisy UI in the project
