## Overview

This plan outlines the implementation of rebuilding peterwarnock.com, a personal
portfolio and blog site, with a stable, maintainable frontend using Hugo,
Tailwind CSS v4, and Daisy UI. The project has progressed through versions
v0.1.0 through v0.14.0, completing the spacing scale implementation, design
system establishment, automated release processes, radar metadata structure,
performance optimizations, and a major infrastructure overhaul. The site is now
production-ready with enterprise-grade testing infrastructure, intelligent build
systems, and safe deployment workflows while preserving all existing
functionality (blog, portfolio, newsletter, social links). Production is
currently running v0.14.0 with comprehensive validation pipelines and
environment management.

## Architecture

The site is a static site generated by Hugo, using Tailwind CSS v4 for
utility-first styling and Daisy UI for consistent component design. Content is
managed in Markdown files, with no backend required. The site is hosted on
GitHub Pages for free hosting with SEO preservation. The architecture includes
CSS variable-based spacing system, PM2 development server management, and
comprehensive validation pipeline.

## Components

- Header/Navbar: Navigation with responsive menu and branding
- Main Content: Blog post listings, individual post pages, portfolio sections
- Footer: Newsletter subscription, social links, contact information
- Layout Components: Responsive containers, cards, buttons using Daisy UI
- Content Components: Blog cards, portfolio items, skill showcases

## Data Model

- Blog Posts: Markdown files with frontmatter (title, date, tags, content)
- Portfolio Data: Static sections for experience, skills, projects
- Site Configuration: Hugo config for site metadata, social links, newsletter
  settings
- Assets: Images, icons, and other media files
