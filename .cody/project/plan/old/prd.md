## Summary
Rebuilding peterwarnock.com, a personal portfolio and blog site, with a stable, maintainable frontend using Hugo, Tailwind CSS, and Daisy UI to resolve style conflicts, improve component architecture, and enable easier maintenance and modifications.

## Goals
- Create a website foundation that's easy to maintain and modify without style conflicts
- Integrate Daisy UI consistently for a cohesive, professional design system
- Ensure proper responsive design and component alignment (e.g., navbar edges matching content)
- Preserve all existing functionality while building on a better architectural foundation
- Enable quick iteration and changes that are immediately visible

## Target Users
Primary audience includes recruiters, colleagues, and potential clients who visit the site to:
- Read Peter's blog posts about technology, leadership, and development
- View his professional portfolio and experience
- Learn about his skills in fullstack development, DevOps, and cloud technologies
- Contact him or subscribe to his newsletter
- Follow his social media profiles

## Key Features
- Blog functionality with post listings, individual post pages, and categories
- Professional portfolio sections showcasing experience, skills, and expertise
- Newsletter subscription system
- Social media links and contact information
- Responsive design with consistent Daisy UI components
- Clear component architecture compatible with Tailwind themes
- SEO-optimized structure maintaining existing URLs
- GitHub Pages hosting compatibility

## Success Criteria
- Agents can make changes (adding sections, modifying layouts, updating components) without encountering style conflicts
- Changes are immediately visible and applied correctly
- Navbar and content edges align properly across all screen sizes
- Consistent Daisy UI styling throughout the site
- All existing features (blog, portfolio, newsletter, social links) are preserved and functional
- Site loads and performs well on GitHub Pages

## Out of Scope
- Complete visual redesign or rebranding

- As a potential client, I want to view his skills and contact him for collaboration opportunities
- As Peter, I want to add new blog posts and portfolio items without dealing with conflicting styles or alignment issues
- As Peter, I want to modify site components and see changes applied quickly and consistently

## Assumptions
- Hugo, Tailwind CSS, and Daisy UI are suitable and compatible for this rebuild
- Existing content (blog posts, portfolio data) can be migrated without data loss
- GitHub Pages will continue to host the site adequately
- No additional budget for premium tools or services
- We may explore minimal themes but will avoid complex community themes that cause conflicts; the custom Daisy UI approach simplifies maintenance
