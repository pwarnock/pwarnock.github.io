## Overview

This plan outlines the implementation of rebuilding peterwarnock.com, a personal
portfolio and blog site, with a stable, maintainable frontend using Hugo,
Tailwind CSS v4, and Daisy UI. The project has progressed through versions
v0.1.0 through v0.9.3, with current work on v0.10.0 spacing scale
implementation. The goal is to resolve style conflicts, improve component
architecture, and enable easier maintenance while preserving all existing
functionality (blog, portfolio, newsletter, social links).

## Architecture

The site is a static site generated by Hugo, using Tailwind CSS v4 for
utility-first styling and Daisy UI for consistent component design. Content is
managed in Markdown files, with no backend required. The site is hosted on
GitHub Pages for free hosting with SEO preservation. The architecture includes
CSS variable-based spacing system, PM2 development server management, and
comprehensive validation pipeline.

## Components

- Header/Navbar: Navigation with responsive menu and branding
- Main Content: Blog post listings, individual post pages, portfolio sections
- Footer: Newsletter subscription, social links, contact information
- Layout Components: Responsive containers, cards, buttons using Daisy UI
- Content Components: Blog cards, portfolio items, skill showcases

## Data Model

- Blog Posts: Markdown files with frontmatter (title, date, tags, content)
- Portfolio Data: Static sections for experience, skills, projects
- Site Configuration: Hugo config for site metadata, social links, newsletter
  settings
- Assets: Images, icons, and other media files

## Major Technical Steps

- Set up new Hugo project with Tailwind CSS v4 and Daisy UI integration
- Create base layout templates with consistent Daisy UI components
- Migrate existing blog posts and portfolio content
- Implement responsive navigation and content layouts
- Add newsletter subscription and social link components
- Configure SEO and GitHub Pages deployment
- Test responsiveness and component alignment across devices
- Implement CSS variable-based spacing scale system
- Set up PM2 development server management
- Create comprehensive linting and validation pipeline
- Address security vulnerabilities and dependency updates

## Tools & Services

- Hugo: Static site generator
- Tailwind CSS v4: Utility-first CSS framework
- Daisy UI: Component library for Tailwind
- GitHub Pages: Free hosting and deployment
- Git: Version control
- Markdown: Content authoring
- PM2: Development server management
- PostCSS: CSS processing
- Stylelint: CSS linting
- Husky: Git hooks
- Automated validation scripts

## Risks & Unknowns

- Potential conflicts with minimal themes if explored
- Ensuring all existing URLs and SEO are preserved during migration
- GitHub Pages limitations on dynamic features (newsletter handled externally)
- Time required to resolve remaining color and alignment issues
- Compatibility of Daisy UI with existing content structure
- Managing CSS variable scope and inheritance during spacing scale
  implementation
- Maintaining zero visual regressions during systematic refactoring
- Balancing automation with manual validation processes

## Milestones

- Milestone 1: Project setup and base architecture (Hugo + Tailwind v4 + Daisy
  UI) - COMPLETED
- Milestone 2: Content migration and basic layouts - COMPLETED
- Milestone 3: Component implementation and responsive design - COMPLETED
- Milestone 4: Testing, SEO verification, and deployment preparation - COMPLETED
- Milestone 5: Final deployment and post-launch validation - COMPLETED
- Milestone 6: Security updates and dependency management (v0.9.3) - COMPLETED
- Milestone 7: Spacing scale implementation with CSS variables (v0.10.0) - IN
  PROGRESS

## Environment Setup

- Install Hugo (latest version)
- Install Node.js and npm for Tailwind CSS v4
- Clone the repository
- Run `npm run dev` for PM2-managed development server
- Configure Tailwind v4 and Daisy UI in the project
- Set up linting and validation scripts
- Configure git hooks with Husky
