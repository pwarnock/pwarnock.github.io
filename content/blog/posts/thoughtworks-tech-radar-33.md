The latest edition of the Thoughtworks Technology Radar, Volume 33, has been
released, offering its usual insightful perspective on the current technology
landscape. This edition is particularly interesting to me as it aligns with a
personal goal I set a year ago to create my own technology radar.

A year ago, I posted on
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/peterwarnock_twtechradar-documentary-activity-7229724622370295808-PvDd/)
about my ambition to develop my own radar, and with the relaunch of my website,
this is now becoming a reality.

The Thoughtworks Radar is an opinionated guide to the technology landscape,
published twice a year. It's based on the real-world experience of Thoughtworks'
global teams. The radar is divided into four quadrants: Techniques, Platforms,
Tools, and Languages & Frameworks. Each "blip" on the radar is assigned to one
of four rings: Adopt, Trial, Assess, or Hold.

This volume highlights several key themes:

- **Infrastructure Orchestration for AI:** The challenges and patterns emerging
  for managing large GPU fleets for AI workloads.
- **The Rise of Agents Elevated by MCP:** The growing importance of agents and
  the Model Context Protocol (MCP) in the AI ecosystem.
- **AI Coding Workflows:** How AI is changing the way we develop software, with
  a focus on providing knowledge to AI coding agents.
- **Emerging AI Antipatterns:** Potential pitfalls to avoid as we increasingly
  adopt AI in our workflows.

I'm excited to dig deeper into this volume of the Radar and to continue
developing my own. The relaunch of my website is a major step in that journey,
and I'm looking forward to sharing more of my own "blips" and observations on
the ever-evolving world of technology.

## Key Takeaways for Developers

For developers and technology leaders, this volume provides valuable insights
into emerging trends and technologies worth watching. The emphasis on AI coding
workflows and agents reflects the rapid evolution we're seeing in development
tools and practices.

The radar continues to be an essential resource for making informed technology
decisions, and I highly recommend reviewing the full volume for detailed
analysis of each blip and the reasoning behind their placement.

## Looking Forward

As I work on my own technology radar, I'll be incorporating many of these
insights while adding my perspective based on hands-on experience with the tools
and platforms mentioned. The intersection of AI development workflows, modern
infrastructure patterns, and emerging languages creates an exciting landscape
for developers to navigate.

Stay tuned for more updates as I continue to develop my radar and share insights
from both the Thoughtworks Radar and my own technology explorations.
