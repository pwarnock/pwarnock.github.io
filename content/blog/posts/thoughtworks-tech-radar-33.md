The latest edition of the Thoughtworks Technology Radar, Volume 33, has been released, offering its usual insightful perspective on the current technology landscape. This edition is particularly interesting to me as it aligns with a personal goal I set a year ago to create my own technology radar.

A year ago, I posted on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/peterwarnock_twtechradar-documentary-activity-7229724622370295808-PvDd/) about my ambition to develop my own radar, and with the relaunch of my website, this is now becoming a reality.

The Thoughtworks Radar is an opinionated guide to the technology landscape, published twice a year. It's based on the real-world experience of Thoughtworks' global teams. The radar is divided into four quadrants: Techniques, Platforms, Tools, and Languages & Frameworks. Each "blip" on the radar is assigned to one of four rings: Adopt, Trial, Assess, or Hold.

This volume highlights several key themes:

*   **Infrastructure Orchestration for AI:** The challenges and patterns emerging for managing large GPU fleets for AI workloads.
*   **The Rise of Agents Elevated by MCP:** The growing importance of agents and the Model Context Protocol (MCP) in the AI ecosystem.
*   **AI Coding Workflows:** How AI is changing the way we develop software, with a focus on providing knowledge to AI coding agents.
*   **Emerging AI Antipatterns:** Potential pitfalls to avoid as we increasingly adopt AI in our workflows.

I'm excited to dig deeper into this volume of the Radar and to continue developing my own. The relaunch of my website is a major step in that journey, and I'm looking forward to sharing more of my own "blips" and observations on the ever-evolving world of technology.
