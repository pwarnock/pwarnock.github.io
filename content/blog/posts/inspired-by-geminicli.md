# Inspired by Gemini CLI: My Journey with Astro Starlight

![Gemini CLI Website](/images/blog/gemini-cli-home.svg)

I was recently exploring the web and came across the official website for the
Gemini CLI, [geminicli.com](https://geminicli.com). As a web developer, I'm
always curious about the technology behind the sites I visit. To my surprise, I
discovered it was built with [Astro Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build/),
a documentation theme for the Astro framework.

This discovery sparked my interest. I had been hearing a lot about Astro and its
"island architecture," but I hadn't had a chance to try it out myself. The clean
and professional look of the Gemini CLI site was the final push I needed to dive
in.

## A New Portfolio Project

To get my feet wet, I decided to create a small demo project. I spun up a new
Starlight site with a single command:

<div class="mockup-code mb-6">
  <pre data-prefix="$"><code>bun create astro --template starlight</code></pre>
</div>

I was immediately impressed with how easy it was to get started. Within minutes,
I had a beautiful, functional documentation site up and running. I documented my
experience and added it as a new project to my
[portfolio](/portfolio/astro-starlight-demo/).

## Adding to the Toolbox

My positive experience with Astro and Starlight led me to add them to the
[Tools](/tools/) section of my website. You can now find dedicated pages for
both [Astro](/tools/astro-web-framework/) and
[Astro Starlight](/tools/astro-starlight-documentation-website-builder/), where
I share my thoughts and some getting-started information.

This little journey, sparked by a visit to a single website, was a great
reminder of how inspiration can strike from anywhere. It also reinforced my
belief in the power of modern web development tools to create amazing
experiences with minimal friction.
