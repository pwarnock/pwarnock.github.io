I'm excited to see Grokipedia take on Wikipedia. Wikipedia, is a good resource,
but it has bias and gatekeepers. Will Grokipedia be a silver bullet? Not likely.
However, the idea of synthesizing all of the ideas on the web is intriguing.
It's essentially where Google and ChatGPT Search are going, too. It will be
interesting to see who comes out most neutral.
