---

I'm a pragmatic engineer and leader who transforms how organizations build and deploy software. I started as a self-taught developer and grew into someone who builds the systems, pipelines, and cultures that let skilled teams move fast—whether that's modernizing legacy monoliths, implementing reliable CI/CD, or helping engineers adopt AI tools without losing sight of fundamentals.

## What Drives Me

**I believe in:**

- **Pragmatism over perfectionism** – Ship working software, iterate based on real feedback
- **Fundamentals over hype** – New tools are exciting, but solid engineering principles endure
- **Building systems, not just code** – The best engineers I know create environments where others succeed
- **Continuous learning** – Technology changes constantly; staying curious is essential

## My Journey

### Self-Taught Developer (Early Career)

I learned to code by building things—websites, applications, tools. No CS degree, just curiosity and persistence. This taught me that you don't need credentials to ship; you need to be willing to break things, read, iterate, and stay hungry.

### Open Source & Knowledge Translation (Growth Phase)

As I grew, I became obsessed with how organizations consume technology. Instead of contributing to projects, I focused on translating powerful open-source tools for teams who needed them—establishing patterns, writing documentation, mentoring engineers. This shift from "do the work myself" to "help others do the work" multiplied my impact.

### Architecture & Infrastructure (Leadership Phase)

My role evolved into system-wide concerns: designing platforms for scale, building reliable deployment processes, establishing SRE practices that improved uptime and reduced incident response time. I led initiatives like:

- Modernizing legacy monoliths into microservices
- Migrating on-premise infrastructure to cloud
- Implementing CI/CD pipelines that reduced deployment time from weeks to hours
- Building engineering cultures where learning and improvement are expected

### AI & Modern Development (Now)

Today I'm at the intersection of traditional engineering and AI. I'm working with AI-powered development tools—exploring how LLMs can augment (not replace) skilled engineers, building AI features into production applications, helping teams adopt these tools without losing sight of reliability and maintainability.

I'm excited about AI's potential, but I'm more interested in fundamentals: Can we still reason about systems? Can we write maintainable code? Are we building something that lasts?
