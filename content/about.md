## My Journey

### Self-Taught Developer (Early Career)

I learned to code by building things—websites, applications, and tools. My
Business Administration degree in Marketing gave me the business perspective to
balance my passion for web development and open-source tools. As Seth Godin
wrote in _Poke the Box_: "All it takes is initiative. Even just a bit." I
grounded this phase in XP and agile principles, creating environments for rapid
iteration and experimentation—where automated testing and safeguards enabled
teams to move fast with confidence and keep learning.

### Open Source & Knowledge Translation (Growth Phase)

As I grew, I became obsessed with how organizations consume technology. Instead
of contributing to projects, I focused on translating powerful open-source tools
for teams who needed them—establishing patterns, writing documentation,
mentoring engineers. This shift from "do the work myself" to "help others do the
work" multiplied my impact.

### Architecture & Infrastructure (Leadership Phase)

My role evolved into system-wide concerns: designing platforms for scale,
building reliable deployment processes, establishing SRE practices that improved
uptime and reduced incident response time. I led initiatives like:

- Modernizing legacy monoliths into microservices
- Migrating on-premise infrastructure to cloud
- Implementing CI/CD pipelines that reduced deployment time from weeks to hours
- Building engineering cultures where learning and improvement are expected

### AI & Modern Development (Now)

Today I'm at the intersection of traditional engineering and AI. I'm working
with AI-powered development tools—exploring how LLMs can augment (not replace)
skilled engineers, building AI features into production applications, helping
teams adopt these tools without losing sight of reliability and maintainability.

I'm excited about AI's potential, but I'm more interested in fundamentals: Can I
still reason about systems? Can I write maintainable code? Am I building
something that lasts?

## Books That Shaped Me

These books have fundamentally influenced how I think about engineering,
leadership, and building organizations:
