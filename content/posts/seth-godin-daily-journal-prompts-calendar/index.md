Ever wish you could turn timeless wisdom into a daily habit? Today, I transformed Seth Godin’s “Notes to myself”—a list of 65 thought-provoking insights—into actionable daily journal prompts, delivered straight to my calendar.

## Why This?

Seth’s 65 insights cover topics like creativity, leadership, integrity, and personal growth. I wanted a seamless, low-friction way to reflect on one each day—a mini-coaching moment, perfectly timed.

## What I Did

- **Rephrased the 65 notes as daily prompts.**
- **Created an .ics (iCalendar) file** with 65 all-day events, one per day, each summarizing a prompt.
- **Each event is marked as “free” (doesn’t block time) and triggers a pop-up reminder at 8:30am**—perfect for journaling first thing in the morning.
- **Importable into Apple Calendar, Google Calendar, Outlook, or any calendar app supporting the .ics format.**

## How You Can Use It

1. [**Download the .ics file.**](seth_godin_journal_prompts.ics)
2. Import it into your calendar app (Apple/Google/Outlook, etc).
3. Each morning for 65 days, you’ll receive a prompt at 8:30am.  
   Use it to journal, reflect, or simply carry the question with you through the day.

> Each prompt is a gentle nudge toward greater clarity, growth, and action.

## FAQ

**Q: Can I start on any date I want?**  
A: The .ics file uses fixed dates for events (mine starts 7/31/2025). If you want your prompts to begin later,[ you’ll need a regenerated file](https://gist.github.com/pwarnock/9fa68bce9647998505d3f9b8856746ef)—or you can manually adjust the events after importing.

**Q: Can this be done with other lists?**  
A: Absolutely. Any set of prompts, affirmations, or questions can be turned into a calendar using this process.

**Q: Why not use a task or reminder app?**  
A: A calendar view provides visual continuity, and you can enable/disable the journal calendar without affecting your main one.

## For the Tinkerers

To make this reproducible for others who want to start on their own Day 1, consider:
- Sharing both the [prompt list and instructions for generating a new .ics](https://gist.github.com/pwarnock/9fa68bce9647998505d3f9b8856746ef) file from any custom start date (Python, Google Sheets, Zapier, IFTTT, etc).
- Pairing with a journaling platform (like Apple Journal or Day One) for archiving longer-form thoughts.
