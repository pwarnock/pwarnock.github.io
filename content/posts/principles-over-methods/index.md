> "As to methods, there may be a million and then some, but principles are few. The person who grasps principles can successfully select their own methods. The person who tries methods, ignoring principles, is sure to have trouble."
> â€”[Harrington Emerson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrington_Emerson), *The Clothier and Furnisher* (July 1911), via [James Clear's 3-2-1 Thursday, July 3, 2025](https://jamesclear.com/3-2-1/july-3-2025).

This quote feels incredibly relevant today. In an era defined by rapid innovation and the rise of [agentic AI](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/agentic-ai), new methods and tools emerge constantly. It's easy to get lost in the sheer volume of techniques. However, Emerson's insight reminds us that understanding fundamental principles is paramount. Methods will always evolve, but a strong grasp of underlying principles allows us to adapt, innovate, and navigate this fast-changing landscape effectively.
