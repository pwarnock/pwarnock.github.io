**Update:** For the latest information on GitHub Copilot in 2025, including its evolution from OpenAI Codex to a multi-model AI assistant, please see our new [GitHub Copilot page](/tools/github-copilot-2025-update/).

GitHub Copilot popularized the concept of AI pair programming. Built on OpenAI's Codex, it brought AI code generation to millions of developers through seamless IDE integration.

## The Mainstream Breakthrough

Copilot succeeded where earlier AI coding tools struggled by focusing on integration rather than replacement. It works within existing workflows, making AI assistance feel natural rather than disruptive.

## How It Works

Copilot analyzes your code context and suggests completions ranging from single lines to entire functions. It learns from the massive corpus of public code on GitHub, giving it broad knowledge across languages and frameworks.

## Strengths and Limitations

**Strengths:**
- Excellent IDE integration across VS Code, JetBrains, and others
- Strong performance on common programming patterns
- Backed by Microsoft's enterprise support and security

**Limitations:**
- Quality varies significantly based on use case
- Can suggest inefficient or outdated patterns
- Requires careful review of generated code

## Best For

- Teams that want AI assistance within existing workflows
- Developers working in well-established languages and frameworks
- Organizations that need enterprise-grade AI coding tools
- Anyone looking for a proven, mainstream AI coding solution
