Cursor represents a bold bet on AI-first development. Rather than trying to retrofit AI capabilities into existing tools, the team forked VS Code and rebuilt it around AI interaction patterns.

## The AI-First Approach

Cursor's interface feels familiar to VS Code users, but the AI integration runs much deeper. You can:
- Edit code by describing changes in natural language
- Generate entire functions from comments
- Have contextual conversations about your codebase
- Get intelligent refactoring suggestions

## Technical Innovation

The tool's strength lies in its context awareness. Cursor doesn't just see the current file—it understands your entire project structure, dependencies, and coding patterns. This comprehensive understanding enables more accurate and relevant AI suggestions.

## Market Position

Cursor proved that developers were ready for AI-native tools. Their success showed that the market wanted more than just autocomplete—they wanted true AI collaboration in their coding workflow.

## Best For

- Developers ready to embrace AI-driven workflows
- Teams working on complex codebases that benefit from AI context awareness
- Early adopters who want cutting-edge AI coding capabilities
- Developers who appreciate VS Code's interface but want deeper AI integration
