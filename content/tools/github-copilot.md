# GitHub Copilot: Then and Now (2025 Update)

## Introduction

GitHub Copilot revolutionized AI pair programming by delivering AI-powered code completions directly inside developers' IDEs. Since its launch with OpenAI Codex, Copilot has transformed significantly with cutting-edge AI models and features in 2025.

For background on GitHub Copilot's original concept and features, see the [original GitHub Copilot page](/tools/github-copilot-original-ai-pair-programmer/).

## GitHub Copilot Then: The AI Pair Programmer

Initially built on OpenAI’s Codex, GitHub Copilot popularized AI-assisted coding by integrating seamlessly with popular IDEs like VS Code. It suggested code completions from single lines to entire functions, learning from a vast public code base. This made Copilot a natural, workflow-friendly assistant rather than a disruptive tool.

## GitHub Copilot Now: Advanced AI Coding Assistant in 2025

By 2025, GitHub Copilot has evolved into a multi-model AI assistant powered by GPT-5 and integrated with Model Context Protocol (MCP) for enhanced context awareness. It offers smarter Copilot Chat, improved debugging, and deeper Visual Studio Code integration including open-source components.

Key advancements include:

- Faster, contextually relevant code completions
- Multi-turn conversations and coding guidance
- AI workflows customized for enterprises
- Still requires developer review for accuracy


## Why the Evolution Matters

GitHub Copilot’s transition from a Codex-based tool to a multi-model agentic assistant shows its adaptation to modern development needs and AI advances. This is part of a broader industry trend toward contextual, interactive AI for software development.
