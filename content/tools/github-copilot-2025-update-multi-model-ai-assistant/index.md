# GitHub Copilot: Then and Now (2025 Update)

## Introduction

GitHub Copilot revolutionized AI pair programming by delivering AI-powered code completions directly inside developers' IDEs. Since its launch with OpenAI Codex, Copilot has transformed significantly with cutting-edge AI models and features in 2025.

## GitHub Copilot Then: The AI Pair Programmer

Initially built on OpenAI's Codex, GitHub Copilot popularized AI-assisted coding by integrating seamlessly with popular IDEs like VS Code. It suggested code completions from single lines to entire functions, learning from a vast public code base. This made Copilot a natural, workflow-friendly assistant rather than a disruptive tool.

## GitHub Copilot Now: Multi-Model AI Assistant (2025)

### Advanced Model Integration
The 2025 version of GitHub Copilot represents a quantum leap forward:

- **GPT-5 Integration**: Leverages OpenAI's latest model for enhanced reasoning and code generation
- **Multi-Provider Support**: Now supports models from Anthropic, Google, and other providers
- **Context Window Expansion**: Dramatically increased context understanding for large codebases
- **Real-time Collaboration**: Multi-user coding sessions with AI assistance

### Enhanced Features
- **Voice-to-Code**: Natural language coding through voice commands
- **Visual Code Understanding**: Can analyze and generate code from screenshots and diagrams
- **Automated Testing**: Generates comprehensive test suites based on code analysis
