Astro is a modern frontend framework designed for building fast, content-driven
websites. It allows you to use your favorite UI components (React, Vue, Svelte,
etc.) and renders them to HTML at build time, resulting in zero JavaScript
runtime by default. This approach leads to incredibly fast load times and
excellent performance scores.

## Core Features

- **Island Architecture**: Ship less JavaScript by rendering UI to static HTML
  and only hydrating interactive components.
- **UI Framework Agnostic**: Use React, Preact, Svelte, Vue, Solid, Lit, or just
  plain HTML + JavaScript.
- **Fast by Default**: Astro generates static HTML at build time, resulting in
  faster load times and better SEO.
- **Content-focused**: Built with content-rich websites like blogs, marketing
  sites, and documentation in mind.
- **Developer Experience**: Great tooling, clear documentation, and a vibrant
  community.

## Getting Started

1. **Installation**: Create a new Astro project with `npm create astro@latest`.
2. **Project Setup**: Choose a template or start from scratch.
3. **Development**: Start the development server with `npm run dev`.
4. **Components**: Build your UI with your favorite framework components.
5. **Deployment**: Deploy your static site to any hosting provider.
