Hugo is one of the most popular open-source static site generators. Written in
Go, it's renowned for its incredible speed and flexibility, making it an ideal
choice for building blogs, portfolios, documentation, and more. Hugo takes your
content written in Markdown and transforms it into a complete static website in
milliseconds.

## Core Features

- **Blazing Fast Build Times**: Generate thousands of pages in seconds.
- **Markdown Support**: Write content in Markdown, a simple and widely used
  markup language.
- **Theming System**: Highly customizable themes to control the look and feel of
  your site.
- **Shortcodes**: Extend Markdown with custom shortcodes for dynamic content.
- **LiveReload**: Instant feedback during development with automatic browser
  refreshing.
- **Asset Bundling**: Optimize CSS, JavaScript, and images for production.

## Getting Started

1. **Installation**: Install Hugo on your system (available for Windows, macOS,
   Linux).
2. **New Site**: Create a new Hugo site with `hugo new site my-site`.
3. **Add Theme**: Choose and add a theme to your site.
4. **Add Content**: Create new content files in Markdown format.
5. **Development**: Run `hugo server -D` to preview your site locally.
6. **Deployment**: Generate your static site with `hugo` and deploy the `public`
   directory to any web server.
