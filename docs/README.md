## Rules for AI Agents

### Before Creating Documentation
1. **Check this index** - Is there already a doc for this topic?
2. **Search `/docs`** - Use grep/find to look for related content
3. **Propose consolidation** - If similar docs exist, suggest merging
4. **Link to parent** - New discoveries → add to existing doc with date

### Adding New Knowledge
- **Bug fix or workaround?** → Add to relevant doc with date stamp
- **New topic/process?** → Propose in `.tmp/` first, link to parent issue
- **Never duplicate** solutions across multiple docs

### Questions?
- Check the quick search table above
- Look for similar keywords across all docs
- If truly new topic: create issue, propose structure in `.tmp/`, wait for approval
