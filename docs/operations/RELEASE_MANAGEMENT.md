# Release Management

This document outlines the release management process for the Peter Warnock portfolio website, ensuring consistent, reliable deployments with proper versioning and rollback capabilities.

## Overview

The release management process follows semantic versioning with automated CI/CD pipelines through GitHub Actions. Each release is tagged, documented, and deployed to GitHub Pages with comprehensive testing and validation.

## Versioning Strategy

### Semantic Versioning

We follow `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` semantic versioning:
- **MAJOR**: Breaking changes, major redesigns, technology stack changes
- **MINOR**: New features, significant content additions, UI improvements
- **PATCH**: Bug fixes, content updates, minor improvements

### Version Naming Convention

Versions use descriptive names for better tracking:
```
v[major.minor.patch]-[descriptive-name]
```

Examples:
- `v0.8.2-tailwind-v4-upgrade`
- `v0.9.0-design-system-overhaul`
- `v1.0.0-production-launch`

### Branch Strategy

#### Main Branches
- **main**: Production-ready code, always deployable
- **develop**: Integration branch for features (future use)
- **release/vX.X.X**: Release preparation branch

#### Feature Branches
- **feature/feature-name**: New feature development
- **bugfix/issue-description**: Bug fixes
- **hotfix/critical-fix**: Emergency production fixes

## Release Process

### Critical Guardrails

⚠️ **MANDATORY**: All changes to main must come through Pull Requests. 
- ❌ **NO** direct commits to main
- ✅ **YES** Release branch → PR → Review → Merge
- ✅ **YES** Lint and validate before creating PR
- ✅ **YES** GitHub Actions must pass before merge

### Pre-Release Checklist

### Release Steps

#### 1. Preparation
```bash
# Pull latest main to ensure release branch includes all changes
git checkout main
git pull upstream main

# Create release branch from main
git checkout -b release/vX.X.X

# Update version numbers
# Update hugo.toml version
# Update package.json version
# Update any other version references
```

#### 2. Pre-Commit Validation
```bash
# REQUIRED: Run linting before any commit
npm run lint

# REQUIRED: Run validation
npm run validate

# REQUIRED: Test build
npm run build
```

**All checks must pass before proceeding. Do not commit with lint/build errors.**

#### 3. Testing
```bash
# Local testing
npm run dev

# Production build test
npm run build:production

# Verify site loads correctly
```

#### 4. Documentation
```bash
# Update docs/releases/RELEASE_NOTES_vX.X.X.md
# Update docs/operations/DEPLOYMENT_NOTES.md with current version
# Create git tag locally (do not push yet)
git tag -a vX.X.X -m "Release vX.X.X: [Description]"
```

#### 5. Create Release PR
```bash
# Push release branch to upstream
git push upstream release/vX.X.X

# Create PR via GitHub CLI (creates PR automatically merged to main on approval)
gh pr create --base main --head release/vX.X.X \
  --title "Release: vX.X.X - [Release Name]" \
  --body "Automated release PR. See docs/releases/RELEASE_NOTES_vX.X.X.md for details."
```

**Important**: Do NOT merge directly. Wait for PR approval.

#### 6. GitHub Actions & Merge
```bash
# After PR is approved:
# - GitHub Actions runs automated checks
# - Merge PR via GitHub UI or:
gh pr merge release/vX.X.X --merge

# Push git tag after successful merge
git push upstream vX.X.X

# Create GitHub Release
gh release create vX.X.X --title "vX.X.X - [Release Name]" \
  --notes-file docs/releases/RELEASE_NOTES_vX.X.X.md
```

#### 7. Post-Release Cleanup
```bash
# Delete release branch locally
git branch -d release/vX.X.X

# Delete release branch on upstream
git push upstream --delete release/vX.X.X

# Verify main matches production version
git log --oneline -1  # Should show version bump commit
```

## Automated Deployment

### GitHub Actions Workflow

The `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` handles automatic deployment:

#### Triggers
- Push to `main` branch
- Creation of new tag
- Pull request to `main`

#### Pipeline Stages
1. **Setup**: Node.js environment, Hugo installation
2. **Build**: Hugo static site generation
3. **Optimize**: Asset minification, compression
4. **Test**: Link checking, accessibility validation
5. **Deploy**: GitHub Pages publication
6. **Notify**: Release notifications

#### Environment Variables
- `HUGO_VERSION`: Hugo version to use
- `NODE_VERSION`: Node.js version
- `GITHUB_TOKEN`: Deployment permissions

### Deployment Environments

#### Production (GitHub Pages)
- **URL**: `https://pwarnock.github.io`
- **Branch**: `main`
- **Trigger**: Automatic on merge
- **Domain**: Custom domain support

#### Staging (Local)
- **URL**: `http://localhost:1313`
- **Method**: PM2 development server
- **Command**: `./scripts/pm2-agent-integration.sh start`

## Rollback Procedures

### Emergency Rollback

#### Quick Rollback (Previous Version)
```bash
# Identify previous stable tag
git tag --sort=-version:refname | head -5

# Checkout previous version
git checkout vX.X.X-previous

# Force push to main (emergency only)
git push --force origin main
```

#### Full Rollback Procedure
1. **Assess Impact**: Determine affected users and systems
2. **Communicate**: Notify stakeholders of rollback
3. **Execute Rollback**: Use quick rollback procedure
4. **Validate**: Confirm site is functioning
5. **Investigate**: Analyze root cause
6. **Document**: Record incident and resolution

### Hotfix Process

#### Critical Hotfix
```bash
# Create hotfix branch from main
git checkout -b hotfix/critical-issue main

# Implement fix
# Test thoroughly
# Commit changes

# Merge to main and tag
git checkout main
git merge hotfix/critical-issue
git tag -a vX.X.X+1 -m "Hotfix: [Description]"

# Deploy immediately
git push origin main
git push origin vX.X.X+1
```
