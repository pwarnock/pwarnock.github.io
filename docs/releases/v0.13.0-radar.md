# v0.13.0-radar - Release Notes

**Release Date:** November 11, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Complete

## Overview

v0.13.0 enhances the tools section with visual radar metadata and refactors the
about page to improve SEO messaging and eliminate duplicate content. This
version prepares the foundation for future ThoughtWorks Build Your Own Radar
(BYOR) integration while strengthening the site's overall messaging.

## Features

### Radar Metadata Exposure

- **Radar badges on tool cards** - Each tool now displays its quadrant
  (Techniques, Platforms, Tools, Languages & Frameworks) and ring (Adopt, Trial,
  Assess, Hold) as visual badges
- **Interactive radar link** - Added "View as Interactive Radar" link to access
  `/tools/radar.json` for tool exploration
- **No breaking changes** - All existing tools functionality preserved; radar
  metadata was already in place

### About Page Refactor

- **Eliminated 35% duplicate content** - Removed redundant "15+ years" and
  "gap/bridge" metaphor mentions
- **Improved SEO messaging** - Reorganized to lead with philosophy (strongest
  differentiator) and updated meta description
- **Better visual hierarchy** - Added proper typography styling (prose classes)
  and spacing for improved readability
- **Clearer career narrative** - Restructured as 4 career phases (self-taught →
  translator → architect → AI explorer) showing clear progression

### Documentation Improvements

- **Environment config clarity** - Documented proper Hugo config merging
  strategy (main + dev override)
- **GTM gating verification** - Documented that GTM/GA only fires in production
  builds via `HUGO_ENV` condition
- **Version documentation** - Updated v0.13.0 design and tasklist in Cody
  framework

## Technical Details

### Config Merging Strategy

- Main config (`hugo.toml`) contains ALL production settings and params
- Dev override (`config/development/hugo.toml`) ONLY overrides dev-specific
  values
- Hugo merges both configs when running dev server:
  `--config config/development/hugo.toml,hugo.toml`

### GTM Security

- GTM script is gated behind `{{ if eq (getenv "HUGO_ENV") "production" }}`
- Development (no tracking): `HUGO_ENV` defaults to "development", GTM skipped
- Production (tracking enabled): `HUGO_ENV=production` required, GTM loads with
  container ID

### Tools Card Enhancement

- Radar badges added to `card-unified.html` (used for tools listing)
- Radar badges also in `card-tools.html` for single tool view consistency
- Badges use DaisyUI styling: primary badge for quadrant, secondary for ring

## Testing

✅ Build verification - Complete build test with no regressions  
✅ Visual testing - Tools cards display radar badges correctly  
✅ JSON validation - `radar.json` generates proper structure  
✅ About page - Proper typography and layout verified
